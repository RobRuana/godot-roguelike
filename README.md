    * tags for console, what tags should be shown? e.g. debug, combat, movement
    * emphasize with colors:
      * entire line can be colored, or only certain words for emphasis
  * hp numbers
  * hp bar
* enemies can't see past each other in narrow spaces
* hide entities that aren't visible
* redo state timer
* restart after death
* refactor out globals, like open rpg
